Inverted index model using python

Step 1: Prepare the data
------------------------
You need to prepare the data for indexing and retrieval. This involves reading in the
documents, preprocessing them (tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming and
Lower Case) using NLTK library, and storing them in a data structure that can be
indexed.

Step 2: Build the index
------------------------
The index is typically an inverted index, which maps each term to the documents
that contain that term.
